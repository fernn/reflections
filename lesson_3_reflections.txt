Question 1:
  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
Reflections:
  It would be useful to use a remote repository if one wants to save the project in the cloud or wheh sharing and 
  collaborating the project with others. Keeping the work local puts constraints on sharing the work with others.
  These commands can be used:
    to add remote: $git remote add <remote_name> <link_to_repository_on_github>
    to view remote: $git remote -v
    to push the current branch to remote: $git push <remote_name> <branch_name>
    
Question 2:
	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
	having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
	repository?    

Reflections:
	Manually pulling changes provides greater control over syncing the
	files in local and remote repositories. 
	These commands to be used for pulling:
		to pull remote to local: $git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>

Question 3:
	Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
	would you use one instead of another?

Reflections:
	I understand fork as copying of a project up to certain point and
	then independent development. It can used when different versions
	have to be developed for the same code. For example android forked
	for implementation on mobile, tablets and tv.
		Clone is a just a copy of the project and its commit history.
	Here it is defined as copying from Github to local or local to local
	Branching refers to creation of branches within a repository. It is
	used to try out new features and experimentation before
	 incorporating the changes to master branch.

Question 4:
	What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Reflections:
	It helps in relative state of the local repository with that of the 
	remote. It helps in resolving merge conflicts. It helps in pushing
	changes to remote. The command git fetch only updates the copy of remote from <remote_name> to <remote_name>/master.
