Question 1:
  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
Reflections:
  It would be useful to use a remote repository if one wants to save the project in the cloud or wheh sharing and 
  collaborating the project with others. Keeping the work local puts constraints on sharing the work with others.
  These commands can be used:
    to add remote: $git remote add <remote_name> <link_to_repository_on_github>
    to view remote: $git remote -v
    to push the current branch to remote: $git push <remote_name> <branch_name>
