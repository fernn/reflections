Question 1:
	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do
	it?

Reflections:
	Initializing a repository creates a .git file. It is needed to create
	this file which will hold the metadata about any commits that will
	be made later.

Question 2:
	How is the staging area different from the working directory and
	the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Reflections:
	Staging area indicates which files are ready to be committed to the
	repository. Advantage is that it allows for a committing all files
	in the staging area at the same time.
